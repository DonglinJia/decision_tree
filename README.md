# Decision Tree

- Simplest machine learning algorithm â€“ supervised
- Structure:
  * Internal nodes: performing a boolean test on input features
  * Leaf nodes: labelled with value for the target features
- Build:
  * determine the order of testing the input features
  * give an order of testing the input features, we can build a decision tree by splitting the examples
  * When do we stop:
    1. All the examples belong to the same class
    2. There are no more features to test
    3. There are no more examples
